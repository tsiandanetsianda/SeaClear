          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            At SeaClear, our mission is to foster a safe and enjoyable beach experience for everyone. We aim to raise public awareness about the importance of water quality, 
            and how it affects both human health and the environment. By providing accessible and reliable information, we hope to encourage proactive steps towards maintaining 
            cleaner and safer beaches.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Water Quality Matters</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Water quality is a crucial indicator of environmental health. Poor water quality can have adverse effects on marine ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. 
            Exposure to contaminated water can lead to illnesses such as gastroenteritis, skin infections, and respiratory problems. SeaClear is committed to providing 
            accurate, real-time information that helps the community stay informed and safe.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Technology</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            SeaClear uses a combination of data science, real-time monitoring, and community engagement to offer comprehensive water quality information. 
            Our platform aggregates data from multiple sources, including official reports and user-submitted observations, to deliver a holistic view of water conditions 
            across Cape Town's beaches. Our advanced algorithms analyze this data to generate easy-to-understand safety ratings, helping users stay informed with minimal effort.
